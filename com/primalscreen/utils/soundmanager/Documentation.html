<h1>Primal Screen SoundManager b.128 Documentation</h1>


<div class="important">
	<strong>Important:</strong> This version is a bit of a leap forward, with a few steps back. There were vast performance
	improvements, and a few	extra features were added, but in the meantime, a few of the less used functions went away, 
	and they're marked in red in this document. Most of them are coming back in a later version, but I wanted to roll 
	this version out ASAP. If you need the newest version from before this change, look 
	<a href="https://github.com/primalscreen/as3/commit/6878f8926c4353d742ed0c46d5f40d777eca64f5">here.</a><br /><br />
	<strong>Format Change: </strong> This version is also the first to support ONLY MP3 format. If you can't use MP3, you're 
	out of luck. Sorry, but I had to consolidate things down to one format, for performance, and MP3 is the obvious choice.
</div>


<h2 style="margin-top:-20px;">Installation</h2>
<p>
	You'll notice that there are Actionscript classes from two separate companies in this download. The Primal Screen classes
	are mine, I wrote them, and they're ope source, MIT licensed. The Greensock classes are from 
	<a href="http://www.greensock.com"> Greensock</a> and <b>carry their own, separate 
	<a href="http://www.greensock.com/licensing/">license model</a> that you must agree to before using SoundManager.</b> 
</p>
<p>Put the <span class="fakepre">com.primalscreen.utils.soundmanager.SoundManager</span> package and the Greensock 
LoaderMax package files in your classpath. Keep the <span class="fakepre">com.primalscreen</span>... and 
<span class="fakepre">com.greensock</span>... folder structures.</p>

<p>
	NOTE: I've only included a subset of Greensock's classes that are used by SoundManager. If you're using any of their 
	other classes, just use your own full set of greensock classes.
</p>

<p>Then instantiate like this (it's a singleton, you can't just use <span class="fakepre">new SoundManager()</span>):</p>
<pre>
// in the package
import com.primalscreen.utils.soundmanager.SoundManager;

// in the class
var soundManager:com.primalscreen.utils.soundmanager.SoundManager;

// in your constructor
soundManager = SoundManager.getInstance();
</pre>







<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3 style="margin-top:-20px;">SoundManager.getInstance() Options</h3>
<p>
	When you first instanciate SoundManager with the <span class="fakepre">getInstance()</span> function, you can pass it an options object. 
	The available options are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>verbose</strong> <em>(Const):</em> Change's how much SoundManager traces to the console. Options are 
		<span class="fakepre">SoundManager.SILENT</span>, 
		<span class="fakepre">SoundManager.NORMAL</span>, 
		<span class="fakepre">SoundManager.VERBOSE</span>, and 
		<span class="fakepre">SoundManager.ALL</span>
		 Defaults to <span class="fakepre">SoundManager.NORMAL</span>.</li>
	<li><strong>trace</strong> <em>(String):</em> When in verbose mode, this is what prepends everything that SoundManager traces. Default 
	is <span class="fakepre">"SoundManager: "</span>.</li>
	<li><strong>queueInterval</strong> <em>(Number):</em> <span class="deprecated">DEPRECATED</span></li>
	<li><strong>samePriorityInterrupts</strong> <em>(Boolean):</em> <span class="deprecated">DEPRECATED</span>
</li>
	
	
</ul>
<p>
	The way to implement these these options is:
</p>
<pre>
soundManager = SoundManager.getInstance({verbose: true, trace:"SoundManager says "});
</pre>


<h3>playSound()</h3>
<p>Now that you have a singleton instance called of SoundManager called soundManager, let's play a sound:</p>
<pre>soundManager.playSound("assets/testaudio.mp3");</pre>
<p>This is the simplest example. It loads the mp3 and plays it when ready. playSound has three arguments. In order they are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Source</strong> <em>(String/Array):</em> the filename, or array of filenames you want to load 
	and play. You can also put numbers in the array, and the numbers will interpretted as gaps between the sounds, in milliseconds.</li>
	<li><strong>Caller</strong> <em>(Object):</em> Usually <span class="fakepre">this</span>, this reference is used later when you're garbage collecting.
	It's a reference to the class that called the <span class="fakepre">playSound()</span>, so that if you ever want to destroy the app/game/class later, and you want to kill
	all sounds associated with it, you can use the <span class="fakepre">stopSoundsFrom(this)</span> function, to stop all sounds that were set up by <span class="fakepre">this</span> class.</li>
	<li><strong>Options</strong> <em>(Object):</em> Like SoundManager's <span class="fakepre">getInstance()</span> function, <span class="fakepre">playSound()</span>
	 can recieve an options object. See below for the available options.</li>

</ul>

<p><span class="fakepre">playSound()</span> has an options object in it's third parameter, here are the available options.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>event</strong> <em>(String):</em> <span class="deprecated">DEPRECATED</span>. See onComplete</li>
	<li><strong>onComplete</strong> <em>(Function):</em> The public function, in the calling class, that should be called when the sound finishes playing.</li>
	<li><strong>onCompleteParams</strong> <em>(Array):</em> An array of parameters that are sent to the onComplete function.</li>
	<li><strong>channel*</strong> <em>(String):</em> The name of the channel you want to play the sound on. *Read more about what a "channel" is, below.
	These aren't real SoundChannels, think of it like if there's a sound playing on channel A, and you play 
	another one on that same channel, it will stop the first sound and play the second. </li>
	<li><strong>priority</strong> <em>(Number):</em> Sets the priority level of the sound. If another sound exists on the same channel,
	the one with the higher priority will play, cutting off the existing sound if necessary.</li>
	<li><strong>eventOnInterrupt</strong> <em>(Boolean):</em> <span class="deprecated">DEPRECATED</span></li>
	<li><strong>dontInterruptSelf</strong> <em>(Boolean):</em> If set to true, when the same sound is requested on the same channel, it will be ignored. Default: false.</li>
	<li><strong>volume</strong> <em>(Number):</em> 0 is muted, 1 is normal volume. Defaults to 1, unless you've already used setVolume();</li>
	<li><strong>loop</strong> <em>(Number):</em> Number of times to loop the sound. 0 is infinite, 1 is default.</li>
	<li><strong>pauseOnTime</strong> <em>(Number):</em> Number of milliseconds to hold the sound out of the queue. It's called "pauseOnTime" because this is used when you want an audio cue to play if a user hovers their mouse over a button.</li>
	<li><strong>pauseOnName</strong> <em>(String):</em> An optional name you can give a pause-on, so you can cancel it later.</li>
	<li><strong>gapless</strong> <em>(Boolean):</em> If you're playing a single sound, that has to loop, you may notice that there's a tiny gap at the end of each loop. This fixes it by overlapping the sounds. It can only be applied to single sounds, not sequences. Don't use it unless you need to, it's a little more overhead.</li>
	<li><strong>gap</strong> <em>(Number):</em> The default gap when using the <span class="fakepre">gapless</span> option is 200ms, which is what works for MP3s that my MP3 converter spits out. If that's not quite right with your audio files, change it here, or change the default with the <span class="fakepre">setDefaultGap()</span> function.</li>
</ul>
<p>So a much more complicated example might be:</p>
<pre>
soundManager.playSound("assets/testaudio.mp3", this, {
		onComplete: myOnCompleteFunction, 
		channel: "sound_effects_channel", 
		priority: 4, 
		volume: 0.5,
		loop: 2
	});
</pre>
<p>Which would make the file, <em>testaudio.mp3</em>, load, then play twice at half volume on a channel called "sound_effects_channel", interrupting anything else on that channel with a priority lower than 4, and calling the <span class="fakepre">myOnCompleteFunction()</span> function when it's done. 




<h3>"Channels" in the SoundManager sense</h3>
<p>
	A channel, when it comes to SoundManager, has been a little confusing to some, so here's a brief explanation. <b>A channel can only have one sound 
	playing on it at a time.</b> No matter what. Period. If you're playing a sound on a channel, let's call them sound ALPHA and channel GAMMA, and then 
	try to play another sound, sound BETA on channel GAMMA, one of two things has to happen:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Sound ALPHA continues to play, sound BETA is ignored.</strong> This happens if ALPHA had a higher priority than BETA, or if any of a couple of the less used "tweak"
		options are used.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Sound ALPHA is stopped and sound BETA plays instead.</strong> This happens if BETA has an equal or higher priority.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The exception to these rules come into play when you've set <span class="fakepre">dontInterruptSelf</span> (in <span class="fakepre">playSound()</span>) to <span class="fakepre">true</span>. 
	In that case, if a sound is about to be interrupted, but the new sound is the exact same sound (by filename(s)), it won't interrupt. 
</p>



<h3>Single sounds, sound sequences, and delays in playSound()'s source (first) argument</h3>

<p>The first argument sent to <span class="fakepre">playSound()</span> is very dynamic. The simplest example you've already seen is sending it a 
string, the filename you want to play.</p>
<pre>
playSound("filename.mp3", this);
</pre>
<p>If you want to play a sequence of sounds, in order, one after the other, you can send it an array:</p>
<pre>
playSound(["filename1.mp3", "filename2.mp3", "filename3.mp3"], this);
</pre>
<p>So what if you want a pause between audio files within a sequence. Simple, just put a number in your sequence array, instead of a string.</p>
<pre>
playSound(["filename1.mp3", 500, "filename2.mp3", 500, "filename3.mp3"]);
</pre>
<p>The above example will play the three files in order, but will pause for half a second (500 milliseconds) between them.</p>





<h3>Using the amplitude (aka volume) of a channel</h3>
<p class="important">
	 This function has been temporarily removed from SoundManager. It will be added back in soon.
</p>
<p>
	Here at Primal Screen when we make games for kids usually we do proper lip-syncing, but sometimes (like when we make games for Sesame Street), we use
	a simple lip-flap based on the amplitude of the sound channel. To do that with SoundManager you'll have to ask SoundManager for the value, since
	SoundManager abstracts sound channels out of your control. Here's an example of lip-flap, asking SoundManager to return the current volume at each frame.
</p>
<pre>
soundManager.playSound("filename.mp3", this, {channel: "dave"});
this.addEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, doLipFlap, false, 0, true);

function doLipFlap(e:Event) {
	// get the current amplitude
	var amplitude = soundManager.getChannelAmplitude("dave"); 
	// number of frames in the mouth animation, from closed to open
	var framesInMouth = 12; 
	// adjust this to make the mouth open wider
	var mouthMultiplier = 1.5; 
	var mouthFrame = Math.round(amplitude * mouthMultiplier * framesInMouth) + 1;
	mike.gotoAndStop(mouthFrame);
}
</pre> 
<p>
	So the function is <span class="fakepre">soundManager.getChannelAmplitude("channel_name", "behavior");</span>. The second string there
	can be "higher", "left", "right", or "average", and it tells SoundManager whether to get the amplitude of the left or right channel of the sound,
	the average of the two, and the higher of the two (defaults to "higher").  
</p>

<br />






<h3>Other SoundManager functions:</h3>
Many of these functions need an id argument to work. That's the id of the sound, and it's return as a Number by the playSound function. If you know 
you'll need to refer back to a sound later, to stop it or change it's volume, do this:
<pre>
var mySound = soundManager.playSound("filename.mp3");
</pre> 
<ul>
	<li>
		<span class="fakepre">setPath("asset/sounds/");</span><br>
		Sets the location, relative to the document root, of the files you're trying to load. Make sure you leave a 
		<span class="fakepre">/</span> at the end. <b>Be carfeul. This applies to your whole app, because SoundManager is a singleton. So if you're
		collaborating with others on a large app and they're using SoundManager too, don't go changing the path, because it applies to everyone.</b>
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="fakepre">setDefaultGap(100);</span><br>
		Changes the default setting for the overlap time when using the <span class="fakepre">gapless</span> option. This may differ depending on your
		MP3 encoder. <b>Don't forget, SoundManager is a Singleton, so this is for everything in the whole app.</b>
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="fakepre">setVolume(0.8);</span><br>
		Sets the default volume for all <em>new</em> sounds. 0 = mute, 1 = 100%. <b>Again, this is for everything in the app.</b>
	</li>
	<li class="important">
		<span class="fakepre">adjustVolume(id, volume);</span><br>
		This function has been temporarily removed from SoundManager. It will get added back in, in a later version. 
		Sets the volume of a given sound, by it's ID (which is returned by <span class="fakepre">playSound()</span>, as mentioned above).
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="fakepre">isPlaying(id);</span><br>
		Checks whether a sound is playing, by it's ID (which is returned by <span class="fakepre">playSound()</span>, as mentioned above).
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="fakepre">isPaused(id);</span><br>
		Checks whether a sound is paused, by it's ID (which is returned by <span class="fakepre">playSound()</span>, as mentioned above).
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="fakepre">isLoading(id);</span><br>
		Checks whether a sound is loading, by it's ID (which is returned by <span class="fakepre">playSound()</span>, as mentioned above).
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="fakepre">soundStatus(id);</span><br>
		Returns a string of a sound's status, or false if the sound doesn't exist, by it's ID (which is returned by <span class="fakepre">playSound()</span>, as mentioned above).
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="fakepre">exists(id);</span><br>
		Returns a boolean of whether the sound (still) exists, by it's ID (which is returned by <span class="fakepre">playSound()</span>, as mentioned above).
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="fakepre">stopSound(id);</span><br>
		Stops the selected sound by it's ID (which is returned by <span class="fakepre">playSound()</span>, as mentioned above).
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="fakepre">pauseSound(id);</span><br>
		Pauses the selected sound by it's ID.
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="fakepre">resumeSound(id);</span><br>
		Resumes the selected sound by it's ID.
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="fakepre">stopAllSounds();</span><br>
		Stops all sounds. Every single one. Even paused ones.
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="fakepre">pauseAllSounds();</span><br>
		Pauses all sounds. Every single one. Anywhere in your app.
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="fakepre">resumeAllSounds();</span><br>
		Resume all sounds. Every single one. 
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="fakepre">stopChannel("channel_name");</span><br>
		Stops all sounds that are playing on the given channel.
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="fakepre">pauseChannel("channel_name");</span><br>
		Pauses all sounds that are playing on the given channel.
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="fakepre">resumeChannel("channel_name");</span><br>
		Resume all sounds that are paused on the given channel.
	</li>

	<li>
		<span class="fakepre">stopSoundsFrom(this);</span><br>
		Stops all sounds that were created by the class/object/movieclip given in the first parameter. There isn't 
		much reason to use anything but <span class="fakepre">this</span> here. When you pass in <span class="fakepre">this</span> 
		as the second parameter for <span class="fakepre">playSound()</span>, SoundManager keeps track of which class originally called 
		the <span class="fakepre">playSound()</span> function. This means that if you call <span class="fakepre">stopSoundsFrom(this)</span> 
		later from the same class, it will stop all sounds called from the class.
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="fakepre">pauseSoundsFrom(this);</span><br>
		In case you haven't already guessed, this function has similar functionality to 
		<span class="fakepre">stopSoundsFrom(this)</span>, but for pausing. Succinctly, pauses all paused sounds from the same caller.
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="fakepre">resumeSoundsFrom(this);</span><br>
		Resumes all paused sounds from the same caller.
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="fakepre">cancelPauseOn("pause_on_name");</span><br>
		Cancels pause-ons that were set up with this name.
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="fakepre">cancelPauseOnsFrom(this);</span><br>
		Cancels pause-ons that were set up by the same calling class/object/movieclip.
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="fakepre">cancelAllPauseOns();</span><br>
		Cancels all pause-ons. 
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="fakepre">muteChannel("channel_name");</span><br>
		Mutes all sounds on the given channel.
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="fakepre">unmuteChannel("channel_name");</span><br>
		Opposite of <span class="fakepre">muteChannel()</span>.
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="fakepre">preload("filename", myPreloadCompleteFunction);</span> or<br>
		<span class="fakepre">preload(["filename1", "filename2"], myPreloadCompleteFunction);</span><br>
		Where second argument is a public function in the calling class which is called when the files are preloaded.
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other helpful code snippets:</h3>
<p>Stopping a specific sound (you have to capture it's returned ID first)</p>
<pre>
var mySoundID = playSound("filename.mp3");
stopSound(mySoundID);
</pre>
<p>Play a few sounds, then when it's time to clean up a class before removeChilding it, stop all sounds that it called.</p>
<pre>
soundManager.playSound("boing.mp3", this);
soundManager.playSound("voiceover.mp3", this, {channel: "vo"});
soundManager.playSound("bang.mp3", this);
soundManager.stopSoundsFrom(this);
</pre>
<p>Setting up a "Pause on". Makes the boing sound play if you leave your mouse over the button for 1000ms. If you move it out after the sound has started, it plays through.</p>
<pre>
button1.addEventListener(MouseEvent.ROLL_OVER, makePauseOn, false, 0, true);
button1.addEventListener(MouseEvent.ROLL_OVER, killPauseOn, false, 0, true);
function makePauseOn(e) {
	soundManager.playSound("boing.mp3", this, {pauseOnTime: 1000, pauseOnName: "boing"});
}
function killPauseOn(e) {
	soundManager.cancelPauseOn("boing");
}
